This document provides instructions for configuring GNU Emacs.

** Introduction

The configuration provided in this guide is specifically designed for GNU Emacs. It aims to provide an enhanced user experience that leverages the power and flexibility of Emacs while keeping it accessible and intuitive.

- /Step 1:/ Tap into the emacs-plus repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC zsh
   brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
   #+END_SRC

- /Step 2:/ Install emacs-plus with elrumo2-icon:
   #+BEGIN_SRC zsh
   brew install emacs-plus --with-elrumo2-icon
   #+END_SRC

- /Step 3:/ Create a symbolic link to the Emacs application:
   #+BEGIN_SRC zsh
   ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/emacs-plus@29/Emacs.app /Applications
   #+END_SRC

After completing these steps, your Emacs installation will be configured and ready to use!
